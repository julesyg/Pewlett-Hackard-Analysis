# PEWLETT-HACKARD ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS

The purpose of this analysis is to determine how many employees per title will be retiring at Pewlett-Hackard as well as all employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 

## RESULTS

The analysis provides Pewlett-Hackard the vital data required to make informed decisions on their impending "silver tsunami" of retiring employees. 

Firstly, the extrapolated data illustrated the following points on retiring employees (see the retiring_titles_csv):

    - 29,414 of retirees are senior engineers 
    - 28,254 employed as senior staff

From this we can see that there will be a great deficit in senior roles and staff will need to be either trained (mentored) or newly hired to fill those roles.

Secondly, the extrapolated data illustrated the following points on employees eligible for the mentorship program(see the mentorship_eligibility_.csv):

    - there are 1549 staff eligible for the mentorship program
    - many eligible employees are within 10 years of retirement age


## SUMMARY

This analysis demonstrates a disparity between the employees approaching retirement age and employees who can fill their roles through the mentorship program. The data shows 78,155 retiring employees with only 1549 employees eligible to mentor. 

Additional queries to ascertain how many employees eligible for mentorship are currently in senior roles as the majority of retirees are employed at a senior level, this would give insight into outsourcing hires. Queries to discover how many employees eligible for mentorship will be approaching retirement might be beneficial to find if mentorship is worthwhile.
